## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **n8n** | Workflow automation platform to connect and manage nodes |
| **OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-Turbo)** | Generates the AI-based LinkedIn post |
| **Google Sheets API** | Logs AI-generated content with timestamps |
| **OAuth 2.0 Authentication** | Used for secure Google Sheet integration |
| **JavaScript Expressions** | Used within n8n to map data dynamically |

## 🔄 Workflow Architecture

**Workflow Design:**
Manual Trigger → OpenAI Node (Generate Post) → Google Sheets Node (Log Data)


**Node Breakdown:**
1. **Manual Trigger:** Starts the workflow when executed.  
2. **OpenAI Node:** Sends a predefined prompt to GPT-3.5-turbo to generate a LinkedIn post.  
3. **Google Sheets Node:** Logs timestamp, content, and execution status.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **Trigger Workflow:** User clicks *Execute Workflow* in n8n.  
2. **AI Post Generation:** OpenAI node generates a 150–200 word professional LinkedIn post.  
3. **Data Logging:** Google Sheets node saves the post content with timestamp and status.  
4. **Result:** Workflow completes successfully in under 5 seconds.

**Sample Workflow Flowchart:**
[Trigger] → [OpenAI Node] → [Google Sheets Node]



## 📈 Sample Output

**Google Sheets Log Example:**

| Timestamp | Content | Status |
|------------|----------|--------|
| 2025-10-17T13:09:08+05:30 | “In today’s fast-paced business world, AI automation is revolutionizing productivity…” | Success |
| 2025-10-17T13:15:22+05:30 | “AI automation is no longer futuristic—it's transforming how teams collaborate and create…” | Success |

**AI-Generated Post Example:**
